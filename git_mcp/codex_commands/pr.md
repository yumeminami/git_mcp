# Pull Request Creation

Create and manage pull requests for completed feature development, ensuring proper review process and integration with the main codebase.

**Focus:** $ARGUMENTS

## Issue Documentation Update

**First, update issue documentation:**

1. **Find Issue Document** - Look for `.claude/issue-*.md` files in current project
   - Read complete implementation history and progress
   - If no issue doc exists, suggest running `/issue` first

2. **Complete PR Section** in the issue document:
   - Update `## ðŸš€ Pull Request (Updated: <timestamp>)` section
   - Document PR creation and details
   - Include PR URL and status
   - Record review process and feedback

## Pull Request Strategy

Create comprehensive pull request with proper process:

1. **Pre-PR Checklist** - ensure readiness for review
2. **Branch Preparation** - clean up commits and push changes
3. **PR Creation** - create detailed pull request with proper description
4. **Review Process** - manage review feedback and iterations
5. **Merge Strategy** - handle final merge when approved

## Pre-PR Validation

Before creating PR, validate:

**Code Quality:**
- All tests passing
