   - Craft a descriptive title linking to issue
   - Create comprehensive description that clearly explains the solution
   - Closes #[issue-id] in description
   - Consider appropriate labels and reviewers

4. **PR Description Template**

5. **Final Steps**

   - Request code review via `get_merge_request_details()` for tracking
   - Monitor CI/CD pipeline
   - Address review feedback

**Workflow Complete!** From issue analysis to PR creation.
