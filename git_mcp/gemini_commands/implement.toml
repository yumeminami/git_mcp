# ðŸ”¨ Implementation

**Focus:** {{args}}

Please implement the planned functionality thoroughly and in great detail, considering multiple approaches and potential edge cases throughout the development process.

## Implementation Process

1. **Create Feature Branch** - based on development plan
2. **Code Implementation** - design optimal code structure and write high-quality, maintainable code
3. **Follow Conventions** - match existing code style and patterns
4. **Error Handling** - anticipate edge cases and implement robust error handling
5. **Code Comments** - add necessary documentation for complex logic

## Best Practices

- Follow existing project patterns and conventions
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Add type hints and documentation
- Consider security implications

Use `get_project_details()` to understand codebase structure and `list_merge_requests()` to review implementation patterns in recent changes.

Use `/test` after implementation to generate comprehensive tests.
