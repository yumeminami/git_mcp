# ðŸ“‹ Development Plan Generator

**Context:** {{args}}

Generate a structured development plan based on the analyzed issue.

## Plan Generation

Create a comprehensive development plan including:

1. **Branch Strategy** - suggest branch name and workflow
2. **File Structure** - what files need to be created/modified
3. **Implementation Steps** - ordered task breakdown
4. **Testing Strategy** - what tests are needed
5. **Documentation Updates** - README, docs, comments

Use `get_project_details()` to understand project structure and `list_merge_requests()` to review existing workflow patterns.

## Repository Context

Analyze current repository structure by running:
- git branch -a
- git status
- Find relevant source files

Based on the issue requirements and current codebase, provide a detailed implementation roadmap.

Use `/implement` to start coding based on this plan.
