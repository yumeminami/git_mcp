# ðŸ“‹ Development Plan Generator

**Context:** {{args}}

Consider multiple architectural approaches and evaluate their tradeoffs deeply before generating a structured development plan.

## Plan Generation

Create a comprehensive development plan including:

1. **Branch Strategy** - determine optimal branch name and workflow approach
2. **File Structure** - analyze what files need to be created/modified and their relationships
3. **Implementation Steps** - provide ordered task breakdown with clear dependencies
4. **Testing Strategy** - design comprehensive test coverage plan
5. **Documentation Updates** - identify README, docs, and comment requirements

Use `get_project_details()` to understand project structure and `list_merge_requests()` to review existing workflow patterns.

## Platform API Planning

**When planning platform integrations**, consult the API documentation in CLAUDE.md:

**GitLab API Resources:**
- API Objects: https://python-gitlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api-objects.html
- Usage Patterns: https://python-gitlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/gl_objects/

**GitHub API Resources:**
- Examples: https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples.html
- API Reference: https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/github_objects.html

**Consider API limitations and capabilities when planning:**
- Rate limiting requirements
- Authentication scopes needed
- Available operations and data structures
- Error handling patterns

## Repository Context

Analyze current repository structure by running:
- git branch -a
- git status
- Find relevant source files

Based on the issue requirements and current codebase, thoroughly evaluate potential approaches and provide a detailed implementation roadmap with clear rationale for the chosen approach.

Use `/implement` to start coding based on this plan.
