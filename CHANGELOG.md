## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.9] - 2025-08-13

### Added
- **MR/PR Detail Functionality**: Comprehensive merge request and pull request analysis tools
  - **New MCP Tool**: `get_merge_request_diff()` - Retrieves file changes and diff content with configurable options
  - **New MCP Tool**: `get_merge_request_commits()` - Gets commit history with comprehensive metadata including SHA, message, author, dates, statistics, and URLs
  - **Cross-Platform Support**: Both tools work consistently across GitLab and GitHub with standardized response formats
  - **Rich Options**: Configurable diff content inclusion, format selection, and filtering capabilities
  - **Production Features**: Binary file detection, Unicode content support, proper error handling, and performance optimizations
  - **Comprehensive Testing**: Validated on real-world scenarios including large MRs (17 files, 31 commits) and complex merges
  - Implementation spans: `PlatformAdapter` base class, `PlatformService` layer, GitLab/GitHub adapters, and MCP server registration
  - Closes issue #19

## [0.1.8] - 2025-08-11

### Fixed
- **PR Command Issue URL Format**: Updated `/pr` slash command template to use full issue URLs instead of `#xx` format
  - Modified `git_mcp/claude_commands/pr.md` to include instructions for extracting issue URLs from `.claude/issue-*.md` files
  - Added bash command guidance: `grep "URL:" .claude/issue-$ARGUMENTS-*.md | head -1 | cut -d' ' -f2`
  - Maintains backward compatibility while enabling full issue URL usage in PR descriptions
  - Fixes issue #11 where PR descriptions used shorthand `#xx` instead of full issue URLs
- **GitLab & GitHub MR/PR Description Bug**: Enhanced description parameter handling in both GitLab and GitHub merge/pull request creation
  - Added explicit description parameter extraction to ensure it's properly passed to platform APIs
  - Added comprehensive debug logging to track parameter flow through MCP → Service → Adapter layers
  - Fixed MCP server to handle description from both direct parameter and kwargs JSON
  - Fixes issue #6 where descriptions were not appearing in GitLab merge requests and GitHub pull requests

## [0.1.7] - 2025-08-10

### Fixed
- **Critical GitLab MR Creation Bug**: Fixed parameter order mismatch in platform service
  - Platform service was passing `title` before `source_branch` to adapters
  - This caused "source_branch is invalid" errors as title was used as branch name
  - Corrected parameter order to: `project_id, source_branch, target_branch, title`
  - Fixes issue #4

### Improved
- **Branch Validation**: Added branch existence verification before creating merge requests
- **Debug Logging**: Enhanced debug output for merge request creation troubleshooting

## [0.1.6] - 2025-08-10

### Fixed
- **GitLab Merge Request Creation**: Fixed "source_branch is invalid" error by properly handling assignee parameter conversion
  - GitLab adapter now correctly converts `assignee_username` to `assignee_id` as required by GitLab API
  - Added username lookup with graceful error handling for invalid usernames
  - GitHub adapter now properly supports `assignee_username` parameter in merge request creation
  - Both platforms now correctly handle assignee assignment during merge request creation

### Improved
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced platform adapter error handling with better logging and graceful degradation
- **API Compatibility**: Improved GitLab and GitHub API parameter mapping for consistent merge request functionality
